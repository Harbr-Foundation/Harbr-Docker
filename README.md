# Harbr-Docker

To deploy Harbr simply run ./up (either the `.bat` or `.sh` depending on your platform) and pass either the `dev` (if you have the dev repos locally) or `release` (if you just want to try out or deploy Harbr).

As long as you have docker installed simply wait 5-15 seconds after downloads complete for the services to spin up.
